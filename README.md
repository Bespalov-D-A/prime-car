### html start pack 2022


---

This package includes life:

1. Working with inserting html blocks (@include)
2. Processing sass and further merging all files into one, as well as minification
3. Convert fonts to woff and woff2
4. Automatic image compression in production mode
5. Replacing images with webP (The original version remains and is a fallback in case the device does not support webP). SVG not being replaced
6. Combining all JS files into one.
7. Convert JS with webpack to older JS versions for better compatibility with older browsers
8. Autoprefixer css
9. Run in server mode. When changes are made, the page will update itself (the public folder will be reassembled)
10. Added residual product files and folders of many editors and tools to .gitignore
11. .prettierrc is at the root and has some settings. If your preferences are different - delete it.
